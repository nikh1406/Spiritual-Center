# Spiritual-Center
Developed a web application using Angular, .NET, and MSSQL, featuring separate sections for admin and devotees, with secure authentication via JWT tokens.

Admins can register new devotees, manage user details, view transaction history, and store profile pictures in AWS through the user management pages.

Devotees can view their transaction history, update their profiles, and make payments, all while accessing personalized information.

Integrated a chat service using SignalR for real-time, one-onone or group communication between admin and devotees, and among devotees, with state management implemented using Ngrx.
